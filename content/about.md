Hi, I'm Arthur. I first started programming in R during my PhD on vascular biomechanics. My work focused on the active (i.e. vascular smooth muscle tone-dependent) mechanisms by which the large arteries - in particular, the aorta - acutely modulate their elastic and visco-elastic properties. During my PhD, I developed a passion for statistics and data analysis. After my PhD, I've obtained a Master's degree in Statistical Data Analysis (major computational statistics). My dissertation "Multilingual Deep Learning models for Entity Extraction in NLP" can be downloaded from the link above.
