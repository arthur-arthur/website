Hi, I'm Arthur and I'm interested in statistics, data science and artificial intelligence. During my PhD on vascular biomechanics, I developed a passion for statistics and started programming - mainly in R. I've obtained a Master's degree in Statistical Data Analysis (Computational statistics). My dissertation "Multilingual Deep Learning models for Entity Extraction in NLP" can be found on this website.
