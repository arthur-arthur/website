Hi, I'm Arthur. I first started programming in R during my PhD on vascular biomechanics. My work focused on the active (i.e. vascular smooth muscle tone-dependent) mechanisms by which the large arteries - in particular, the aorta - acutely modulate their elastic and visco-elastic properties. Being highly fascinated by statistics and the possibilities of (computational) tools to collect, tidy, analyze, visualize and interpret data, I decided - upon finishing my PhD - to commit for a Master's degree in [Statistical Data Analysis](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/master-of-science-in-statistical-data-analysis-en) (major computational statistics) at Ghent University. My dissertation "Multilingual Deep Learning models for Entity Extraction in NLP" can be downloaded from the link above.
